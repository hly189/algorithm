1.This is the source latex of collection of algorithm. Most of the algorithms in this file are from Math 128A+B from UC Berkeley, and I take it from my lecture note + books. Moreover, it supposes to help me to quickly access when I need it. \\
2.On the other hand, I will post the .pdf file in the dropbox link instead of uploading to github. \\
3. You can find most of the algorithm in this file in Matlab or R in my github. \\
4. I am in the process of updating my latex frequently. Therefore, you may see it as incomplete in the .pdf file
